# DEMO : HACHICUPS CDKTF with TYPESCRIPT

This repository contains a demo of how to provision the hachicup education infrastructure using a simple CDKTF template and the filesystem as ressources. (Folders & files).

# prerequisite :

- NPM 9.5.0
- node 9.5.0
- Terraform: 1.4.4
- Docker : To run the terraform hachicups provider 20.10.24
- CDKTF: 20.10.24

# How To :

- Run pnpm install to install all the dependencies.
- Start the docker provider: `cd packages/iac/provider && docker compose up`
- Create the hachicup user in your container : `curl -X POST localhost:19090/signup -d '{"username":"education", "password":"test123"}'`
- Provision your infrastructure: In `packages/iac/orders` : Folders represent destinct orders, their content represents order's items and the file's content the quantity of each item.
- Run `cd packages/iac/provider && cdktf deploy` to sync and deploy your infrastructure into the hachicup container.
- Run `cd packages/iac/provider && cdktf destroy` to destroy and reset all the provisoned ressources.
- Other utils commands can be found in `packages/iac/help.ms`.

# To Do :
- Unit tests, mocks.
- Container to run the package. (With cdktf, terraform, node).

  You can find all prebuilt providers on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:cdktf
  You can also install these providers directly through npm:

  npm install @cdktf/provider-aws

  npm install @cdktf/provider-azurerm
  npm install @cdktf/provider-docker
  npm install @cdktf/provider-github
  npm install @cdktf/provider-null

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers
